This provider contains some tweaks that fix common issues using an Oracle data source. This provider is built with a dependency on Oracle's ADO provider, which you will need to install first. See these articles for more information: After the above components are installed, you can add a new data source in ODX that uses the provider. If you receive the error below, set the 'out of range date conversion' option to 'MS SQL min/max date'. Follow the steps below. ",
