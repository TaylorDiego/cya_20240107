    "Text": "Semantic tables are part of the semantic model thatcomprises the serving layer in a data warehouse and represents theculmination of all the extraction, transformation, and loading that happens prior to the tables being added to the semantic model. In addition to the data source fields that can be included in the semantic tables, there are also various other types of fieldsthat can be added. This article clarifies how to add a custom measure to a semantic table. Click the following link for more information on semantic fields in general. Semantic Fields Custom measures areused to produce values that may not be availabledirectly inthe data source, such as the profit measureused in the example below. Note: Custom measures use a script to calculate the value of the measure. Use the following steps toadd a custom measure.  Note: Note: Profit % Default Edit Custom Measure   Variant Qualified Semantic field Name The set up for the Tabular and PowerBI Premium endpoint is shown in the following window: Sales  SUM Profit  Sales - Cost  Hi Thomas, Great tutorial. Would be nice if it becomes possible to copy/paste measures (within and across semantic layers), since a lot of measures often use similar fields or calculations. Regards, Devin ",
