    "Text": "TimeXtender 6024.1 This article describes the software requirements needed to run TimeXtender. It does not cover hardware requirements or recommendations on server configuration. Refer to Microsofts recommendations for Microsoft SQL Server sizing when deciding your hardware needs and configuration. Minimum software requirements to run TimeXtender are listed below. These are split into two areas: Application and Database. When TimeXtender is installed on a server which does not run Microsoft SQL Server, then those requirements must manually be installed. If Microsoft SQL Server and TimeXtender reside on the same server then all components (except the .NET Framework) are already installed by Microsoft SQL Server installation. When installing TimeXtender on a separate server from Microsoft SQL Server, the following components need to be installed or configured: IPv4 Using a Microsoft Azure SQL server requires the application server to be installed with the following components: The Application Server requirements also apply to a scenario where TimeXtender is not installed on a dedicated application server but has multiple installations on each developers workstation as a client application. In this case, any machine that has TimeXtender on it without SQL Server is considered an Application Server and will need to comply with the software prerequisites for the Application Server. On Microsoft SQL Server, the above requirements (except the .NET Framework), are installed during the SQL installation. In addition to those, the following minimum requirements must be met: Standard Enterprise features This section will help you make sure you have met the necessary requirements. The .NET version can be verified by: Microsoft SQL Server Native Client, Microsoft SQL Server System CLR Types and Microsoft SQL Server Management Objects can all be found by checking the list of installed programs. Programs and Features The image below shows the necessary requirements listed above have been met. It also shows that Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (64-bit), is installed. Sign in Instances TimeXtender Portal Grant Access to Instances A few common errors due to lack of prerequisites are listed below. Note: TimeXtender supports newer versions of OS, includingWindows 11 and Windows Server 2022. ",
