The purpose of removing unused objects is to remove table references (also referred to as sources) that no longer exist in the DW instance. For example, if a table is brought into a data area from an ODX instance and then this data area table is later deleted, then selecting remove unused objects will remove table references that no longer exists from the DWinstance repository.
