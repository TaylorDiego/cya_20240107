    "Text": "Once you have selected and moved tables from the ODX (or an alternate Data Area) into a new Data Area, there are many more actions that you can perform, such as lookups and transformations, and these actions may require the creation of relationships between the various tables. Start by identifying a field that exists in both tables that can be used to create the relationship, i.e. an ID field that has unique values in at least one of the two tables. To create the relationship, drag the ID field from one table onto the corresponding field in the other table, i.e., dragging the ID field from the One table to the corresponding field in the Many table. The two fields above need to be of the same data type for this to be possible For example, a varchar field cannot be used with an nvarchar field to create a relationship. However, an nvarchar(20) field can be used with an nvarchar(50) field to create the relationship. When dragging the field from one table to another, a + icon will appear next to the mouse pointer when hovering over a field that is compatible based on matching data types. It is possible to create more than one relationship between two tables. If two tables are already related, then a message will appear asking if a new relationship should be added or whether the existing relationship should be extended. Extend an existing relation The relation can be amended after it is created. The following are the relationship options. The default relation setting can be configured in the Edit Instance menu. Relation  is the default setting since the other options may result in data being filtered out and not available. The primary purpose of relating tables is to assist in the creation of data area lookups as well as the creation of relationships in the semantic model. Supernatural keys can also be used when creating table relationships since they may expedite the process, streamlining the steps needed to populate the foreign keys in the fact table. Lookups are created as follows: Once your table relationships are in place, creating a new lookup is as simple as dragging a field from one table to the other. default relation Conversely, you have the option to not use the default relationship, which allows you to copy over relationships that were previously created as well as adding completely new relationships. Existing table relationships in your data areas can be helpful when building your Semantic model, as these relationships will automatically be detected along with a prompt asking whether this relationship should be brought over along with the table. many-to-one one-to-many Thus, the existing table relationships in the data areas helps facilitate the creation of these relationships in the Semantic model.
