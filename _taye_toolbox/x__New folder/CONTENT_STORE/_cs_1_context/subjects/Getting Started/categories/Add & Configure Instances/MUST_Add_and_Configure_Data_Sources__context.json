The data source will not be clonedin the TimeXtender Portal. After cloning, the data source connection will be duplicated in the TimeXtender Desktop. Cloning can be helpful in creating copies of data source connections that are heavily customized. Tasks in an ODX Instance Tasks in an ODX Instance Tasks in an ODX Instance security roles in an ODX instance Table and Column Selection in an ODX Instance All rows of data are transferred from a table unlessa row filter rule is added that matches the table. The rule defines the criteria a row needs to have to be included, e.g. an ID over a specific number or a timestamp later than a specific date. To filter out rows of data from transfers, follow the steps below.  The ODXServer can load data incrementally to get the latest data quickly and with minimal load on the data source. Since the ODX is built for handling sources with a lot of tables, you do not pick individual tables to load incrementally. Instead, you define the rules for when incremental load should or should not be applied. For information on how to setup incremental load, see the following guide:  To handle updated and deleted records in the source on incremental load, the ODX server needs to know the primary key on each table. There is a rule-based interface available for defining primary keys. To set up primary keys for a data source, follow the steps below.  Data types can be overriden in order to make fields from the data source \"fit\" the data type on an ODX storage.For information on how to override data types, see the following guide:  With the query tables feature, you can enter a SQLquery that the ODXwill turn into a table that works just like any other table in the ODX. This is useful, for instance, when a table cannot be extracted from the data source by the regular ODXlogic. To add a query table, follow the steps below.
