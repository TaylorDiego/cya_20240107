        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Deployment in TimeXtender is used to take table definitions from the TimeXtender Desktop and generate scripts that create tables and their associated stored procedures in the data area storage."

        "question": "What are the two processes commonly performed one after the other in TimeXtender?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Deploy and Refresh",

        "question": "What is the primary purpose of executing tables in TimeXtender?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "To modify the structure of existing tables",
            "option_b": "To transfer and cleanse data into tables that have been deployed",

        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Execution of tables in TimeXtender is done to transfer and cleanse data into tables that have already been deployed, ensuring the data is ready for use."

    , "question_4": {
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a step in the execution of tables in TimeXtender?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Truncating the Raw Table",
            "option_b": "Transferring data from the ODX Store to Raw tables",

        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "Creating new tables is part of the deployment process, not the execution process. Execution involves transferring and cleansing data in already deployed tables."

            "option_d": "To log execution times and row counts only"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "An execution package in TimeXtender is used to define which objects in an instance will be executed and the manner of their execution, not just for scheduling notifications or logging data."

        "question": "In TimeXtender, what restriction applies when adding tasks to a job?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Tasks from different ODX instances can be added to the same job",
            "option_b": "A job can contain both execution packages and ODX tasks",
            "option_c": "Only tasks relating to one ODX instance can be added to a job",
