        "question_facts": [
            "The question assumes prior knowledge of the specific RSD file setup process which may not be common knowledge, creating potential confusion. The correct option, \"option_a\", suggests renaming the file to 'Users', but does not provide context as to why this specific name is chosen, which could lead to misunderstanding if the student hasn't worked with a system where this is a standard procedure. Additionally, the explanation relies on context that is not provided within the question, assuming that the instructions are clear and known to the student. If the context is not part of common curriculum or the question does not reference a specific text or instruction set, it may be too obscure for students to answer correctly. The question also lacks clear instructions on whether these are exhaustive next steps or if they should select the best next step from the options provided. Options B, C, and D seem arbitrary and could mislead students, especially when considering best practices for data security and management. There is no information in the provided article supporting these options, so their inclusion may not be valid."
