            "The question is relevant to the material. The original text includes the information about the \"Row Scan Depth\" field and states that the default value is set to 100. The test question accurately reflects this information.",
            "The answer provided as 'option_b' is TRUE. The default Row Scan Depth value when setting up a connection to a local Excel file is indeed set to 100, as per the information in the provided article.",
            "The question is good and not 'BS'. It asks for a specific default setting related to software configuration, which is factual and can be clearly answered. According to the article provided, the correct answer is indeed '100', which matches the designated answer 'option_b'. The explanation given is straightforward and provides context as to what the Row Scan Depth value does, which is helpful for understanding the purpose of the setting.",
            "The question appears to be clear and relevant to someone needing to know about setting up connections to Excel files. However, there are a few issues that could be improved upon:\n\n1. **Ambiguity and Clarity**: The term \"Row Scan Depth\" is not widely used or understood without context. The question should clarify what software or context this setting applies to.\n2. **Accuracy**: The question implies that \"Row Scan Depth\" is a universally recognized setting with a default value for local Excel files, which may not be the case across different programs or platforms. There is no mention of the software or tool in which this default value is applicable. Is it a specific database tool, Excel itself, or another application?\n3. **Distractors**: The distractor options (option_a, option_c, and option_d) might not effectively test the knowledge of the student if they can easily guess that extreme values (such as 0 for no limit or a very high number like 10000) are less likely to be defaults.\n4. **Explanation**: The explanation given with the answer is useful but it should clarify the context or software to which it is referring. It doesn't say which provider or product uses this default setting, which might confuse students if they're using a different tool or version where this doesn't apply.\n5. **Option Labels**: The labels for the options are inconsistent. If option_b is '100', then option_d should likely be '1000' (not '10000'), according to the context provided by the Lists in the article. The test question has a typo or an error in the options provided.\n6. **Relevance**: Ensure the question is relevant to the curriculum. If this setting is not part of what students are expected to learn, the question might not be appropriate.\n\nIf the goal is to have students understand default settings for software tools, the question needs to be more specific about the context in which these settings apply.",
            "Rating: 5\n\nThe question clearly states what it is asking, provides distinct answer options, and includes an accurate and informative explanation. It measures specific knowledge about a particular software setting, which is relevant for users who need to understand or configure this kind of connection."

            "The test question is relevant to the original material. The material specifies that when connecting to a SharePoint file using the Microsoft Excel Online provider, OAuth is the required authentication scheme.

It is asking specifically about the authentication scheme required for connecting to a SharePoint file through Microsoft Excel Online, and according to the provided article, the correct answer is OAuth.

There are no trick elements or misleading components to this question, making it straightforward for someone knowledgeable in the area to answer.",
            "The question is generally clear but here are a few potential issues:\n\n1. **Assumed Knowledge**: The question assumes the test-taker is familiar with the Microsoft Excel Online provider and its use with SharePoint files, which might not always be the case.\n\n2. **Technical Specificity**: It is not specified which version of SharePoint or Excel Online is referred to. Authentication methods could vary with different versions or updates.\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**: No context is provided as to why OAuth is the required authentication scheme. An explanation that touches on alternative authentication methods and why they are not used might be helpful for understanding.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Options**: Including \"API Key\" and \"Windows Authentication\" might be misleading if they are not applicable to the Microsoft Excel Online provider. Test-takers could be confused if they have used these methods in different contexts.\n\n5. **Explanation Depth**: The explanation provided with the answer is very brief. Expanding on why OAuth is required and how it works compared to other options could enhance the learning outcome. \n\n6. **Current Relevance**: If there have been any updates since the knowledge cutoff, the question may not reflect the current state of technology. The question should be checked for currency.",
