The explanation is brief and doesn't provide much educational value beyond confirming the correct answer.\n4. The question assumes the Execution Queue has only three states for tasks, which may not cover all possible states now or in the future.\n5. If the Execution Queue interface or its functions change after the knowledge cutoff, the question and answer may become outdated.\n6. The question does not cover the depth of the Execution Queue's functionality, such as filtering options or additional details it may provide, which could be an educational aspect for more advanced users.",
