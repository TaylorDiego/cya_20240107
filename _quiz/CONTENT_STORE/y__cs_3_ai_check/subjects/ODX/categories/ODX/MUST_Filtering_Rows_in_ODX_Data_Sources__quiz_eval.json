            "The question is grammatically correct and clear. However, the answer options could be slightly misleading. The correct answer, 'option_b', states that the row filter rule is to define criteria for rows to be excluded, but according to the provided article, the rule is for both including and excluding rows based on the criteria. The explanation provided with the answer is accurate as it mentions that the rule determines which rows should be included or excluded. To improve clarity, consider revising 'option_b' to reflect that the rule is used for both including and excluding rows.",
            "The question about the primary purpose of adding a row filter rule in ODX data sources is relevant to the material provided. The correct answer, option B, matches the information in the article which states that a row filter rule is used to define criteria for rows to be included in the transfer to ODX storage, thereby implying that rows not matching the criteria will be excluded. The explanation provided with the question accurately reflects the intent of the row filter rule as described in the material.",
            "The answer provided as 'option_b' is TRUE. The explanation correctly states that a row filter rule is used to define criteria to include or exclude rows during the transfer to ODX storage. The sourced article supports this by mentioning that rows of data are transferred unless a row filter rule is added to define criteria for inclusion, which implicitly means exclusion of non-matching rows.",
            "The question seems good, not 'BS'. It asks about the purpose of a row filter rule in ODX data sources, which is a straightforward concept related to excluding certain data based on defined criteria. The correct answer provided ('To define criteria for rows to be excluded from transfer to ODX storage') is consistent with the explanation and the referenced article, which explains that these rules are used to determine which rows should be transferred or omitted. There are no trick elements or ambiguous language that could confuse or mislead a test-taker.",
            "The question might be misleading since it implies that the sole purpose of the row filter rule is to exclude rows, when in fact, it can also include them based on the criteria defined. The explanation provided does not entirely match the correct answer; it states that the rule is for including or excluding, but the correct answer suggests exclusion only. Furthermore, the question does not specify the context in which the row filter rule is used, potentially confusing candidates unfamiliar with ODX. There is also no mention of the potential impact on performance or data quality, which are important considerations when filtering data. The question could benefit from clarification and a more comprehensive explanation that aligns with the functionality of row filter rules.",

Lack of specificity about what ODX is, which could confuse students who are not familiar with the term.\n2. \"A row's color\" and \"The font style of text in a row\" are not typical database filter criteria, which might mislead students about how databases are filtered.\n3. The question does not specify the context or the type of ID (e.g., numerical, alphanumeric), which could confuse students about what types of IDs can be used in filter criteria.\n4. \"The number of characters in a row\" is vague and could be interpreted in multiple ways; it is unclear whether this refers to a particular field or the entire row.\n5. The explanation is generic and does not explicitly state why the other options are incorrect or inapplicable to ODX filtering rules.",

            "Problems with the question:\n\n1. The term \"ODX\" is not explained. Not everyone may be familiar with what ODX stands for, which could confuse those not experienced with the specific context.\n2. Option A suggests a manual deletion which seems impractical and could be misleading if the process is supposed to be automated within ODX.\n3. Option C suggests exporting data to a CSV for filtering, which might not be relevant to the ODX process and could confuse test takers about the capabilities of ODX.\n4. Option D mentions running a SQL query, which might imply that direct manipulation of the database is a recommended first step when it may not be.\n5. The correct answer, Option B, includes an action (\"click\") that might not accurately reflect the steps described in the reference material, which mentions right-clicking the data source.\n6. The explanation does not match the options provided. It says to \"right-click\" whereas the correct option says just \"click,\" which could lead to confusion.\n7. The answer lacks context as it assumes the test-taker understands the interface of ODX without providing background information.\n8. The question does not specify what kind of test or user role it is intended for, which could be relevant for understanding the appropriate level of technicality.\n9. There is no indication of whether this is a multiple-choice question or if multiple answers could be correct, making it unclear how the test taker should approach answering.\n10. The question could be more specific about what it means to \"filter out rows\" as this could involve creating a filter rule, applying it, or verifying its application.",

There might be confusion with option A, as it suggests a global rule which is contrary to the specific nature of the question. Option C could mislead test-takers into thinking emailing support is a legitimate way to apply rules in software, which is not standard practice and could be considered a distractor that doesn't add value to the question. Option D suggests a method that isn't related to filtering but rather to renaming, which could be misleading if test-takers are not thoroughly familiar with data management practices.",
