            "The question lacks specificity regarding the version of TimeXtender, which may lead to confusion as features and functionalities can change between versions. The term \"data source\" could be ambiguous as it doesn't specify the type of data source, which can be important given that the process may vary. The option \"By executing a pre-existing task\" is misleading since executing a task would not involve adding a task, but rather running one that already exists. Option B's \"By importing tasks from another project\" is also potentially misleading as it implies that tasks can be imported, which might not be a feature of TimeXtender, and if it is, it's not the standard method for adding tasks.\n\nThe explanation provided with the answer is not detailed enough to fully understand the process and does not mention whether this applies to all types of tasks or just some specific ones. It could be beneficial to include a reference to version-specific documentation or a note that the procedure is based on a specific version of TimeXtender to ensure accuracy.
