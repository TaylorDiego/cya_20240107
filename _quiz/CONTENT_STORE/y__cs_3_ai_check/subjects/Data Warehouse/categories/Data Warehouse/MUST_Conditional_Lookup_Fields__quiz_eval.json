The original material clearly states that \"Conditional lookup fields are used to look up values from a field in another table in the same data area within a Data Warehouse instance.\" This matches the answer 'option_c' which is \"To look up values from a field in another table within the same data area.\" The explanation for the answer is also consistent with the description in the material.",

The question asks for the primary purpose of conditional lookup fields in TimeXtender, which are indeed used to look up values from a field in another table within the same data area, as stated in the provided answer and supported by the explanation from the scraped content. The question is straightforward, the answer is correct, and there is a clear explanation available, making this a valid test question for someone familiar with TimeXtender's features."
