This would allow a careless user to make bad circular references; it also allowed careful users to make functioning circular references. In newer versions, circular reference detection works properly, and will not allow you to deploy any object that contains such a reference. This means that certain objects may not deploy properly after upgrading.

Due to this, they have also not been mapped to their source tables. Parameter Guide lineage In general, make sure everything is related and is known by the object which uses it. ",
