    "Author": "Thomas Lind",
    "Text": "If you have a script that is used to fill a custom table, you may get duplicates, if you do nothing about it. The reason it doesn't get truncated, is that there is no data transfer on a custom table. You have a custom table insert. It uses a select statement instead of a table Insert Into command to fill a table. Every time you execute this the line amount doubles. There are three methods to fix this. Guide here The benefit of using method 3 is that it is easy to see what the script does and what table it affects.  ",

                "Instead of using a custom script and then calling it as a Pre Step. You use the Custom Table Insert feature. Guide here. You use the same script as before, but remove the insert into the statement. This truncates the table."
