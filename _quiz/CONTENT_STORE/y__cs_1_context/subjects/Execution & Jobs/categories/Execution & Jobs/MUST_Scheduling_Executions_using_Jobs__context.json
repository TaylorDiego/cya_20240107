    "Text": "TimeXtender 6024.1 On-Demand Data Warehouse Ingestion TimeXtender 6134.1 Jobs are used to schedule executions for ODX, Data Warehouse, and Semantic Model instances. For ODX instances, jobs are used to schedule synchronization, transfer, and storage management tasks. For Data Warehouse and Semantic Model instances, jobs are used to schedule execution packages. Configure theTimeXtender Execution Service Open Execution Execution packages Add Execution Package. Open Execution Execution packages Add Execution Package. An execution package determines which objects in an instance will be executed and how. The following window shows setup options for an execution package in a Data Warehouse instance. The following window shows setup options for an execution package in a Semantic Model instance. To setup an execution package, follow the steps below. Jobs Add Job Next Note_Only tasks relating to one ODX instance can be added to a job. In other words, tasks from different ODX instances cannot be added to the same job. Furthermore, a job can contain either execution packages or ODX tasks, not both in one job.  Schedule   Right-click on the job,to edit or delete it. Manage Schedule Right-click on the job to view the execution log for the job. Use the date, status and severity filters to search through the execution log for the job. Jobs Monitor The Job Monitor shows if a job is valid, the state of the job, its execution state, and the last execution date. A job will be shown as invalid if the Execution Server Configuration has not been setup for the instances related to the job. When a job is run, the state of the job will change from Idle to Active, and the execution state will then change to Running and, once done, to Completed. Notifications can be used to alert specified individuals when the execution package was successfully run or in case something caused it to fail. Notifications are most commonly set up as email alerts, but can be saved to the Event Log as well.  Mail.Send, SMTP.Send and User.Read Admin grant consent without Multi-factor Authentication The notification can now be selected when you create an execution package. You can choose what objects to prioritize during a managed execution. This is useful if you, for instance, only have a small timeslot for extracting data from a source, or If you would like to have a certain cube ready for the users as early as possible during execution. To set up a new prioritization for use in an execution package, follow the steps below. If you want to execute an execution package only under certain conditions, you can add a usage condition to the execution package. To add a usage condition to an execution package, follow the steps below. If you try to manually execute a package with a usage condition that evaluates to \"true\", a warning message will pop up. The same message will be written to the log if you try to execute the package in a scheduled execution. Warning: Data on demand Advanced Settings 1. On TX Desktop, edit your data source Advanced Settings Data on demand  Whats do the option Log Row Count? @rvgfox With the log row countoptionenabled in an execution package, you can see the row count on an individual table by execution (for that particular execution package). This can be seen by right-clicking on the table and selecting View Execution Overview Log. Then select Raw Rows under Measures Which will show the following: You can also see which execution package that the data was logged from in the lower left corner under the Logs section. Data on demand   @rvgfox  @Jan Stroeve or  On-Demand data warehouse ingestion How do I temporarily disables jobs from running, without deleting them? @Bitmetric_Maarten There is no way to specifically stop a job from running on a set time, but you can always remove or change the start times to be only run once earlier on the current day. Hi Thomas. Thats unfortunate, since we would like to keep these jobs running continuously on the production server. But, sometimes also the PRD server needs changes or updates and these could/will interfere with the jobs running. I saw the request also mention on the ideas page. Is it part of the roadmap? ",
