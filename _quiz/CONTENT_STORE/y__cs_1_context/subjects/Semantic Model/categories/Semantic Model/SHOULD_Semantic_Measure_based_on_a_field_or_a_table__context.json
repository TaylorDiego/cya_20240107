In addition to the data source fields that can be included in the semantic tables, there are also various other types of fieldsthat can be added. This article clarifies how to add a semantic measure that is based on a table or afield. Click the following link for more information on semantic fields in general. Semantic Fields Semantic measures can be created based on either a table orfields within the table. The following two sections clarify how to create these two types of measures.
