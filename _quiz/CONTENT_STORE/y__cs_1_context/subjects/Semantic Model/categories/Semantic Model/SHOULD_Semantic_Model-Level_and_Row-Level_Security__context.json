TimeXtender Semantic Security allows developers to implement role based accessto the semantic model, providing access to either the entire semantic model, or asubset of the model data that isrelated to specificfield values. Model-Level Security is configured by creating a role that is not associated to any row-level security setup,and then associating that roleto an endpoint. This associationwill grant full access to the endpoint for all the members of that role. Row-Level Secuirty is configured according to the following general steps that are outlinedin more detail below. A Row-Level Security Setup is created under a specific field and specifies which field values that the role will have access to, which also means that the role will not have access to data that is related to the field values that are not specified as part of the setup. In this way, roles and row-level security setups work together to provide a security layer to the semantic model based on the identity of the user that is accessing it. For example, the TerritoryWest security setup shown below is based on the Territoryfield and is granting access to the subset of data that is related to the West Territory field value. Any role associated with this security setup will not have access to data that is outside of theWest territory.  The specific steps for implementing model-level and row-level security are outlined as follows. Use the following steps to add a role.  Mapping a role to an endpoint will providemodel-level access to that endpoint for the members of that role, provided the role does not have an associated row-level secuirty setup.Use the following steps to map a role to an endpoint. Roles   Note: Row-Level Security Setup There are two types of row-level security setups that are available: row-level security setup.  Note: dynamic row-level security Dynamic Row-Level Security Setup  OK Row-Level Security Setup Role Role Members Row-Level Security Setup Role.  How to Setup Up Row-level Security Multiple Roles can be associated with the same Row-Level Security Setup and vice-versa, providing flexibility in the deployment of the access security. Thetwo basic approaches are as follows: As hinted above, Analysis Services and Qlik handles security differently: Example 1: Using All to represent all the field values: Dynamic Row-LevelSecuritySetup The semantic FullName field has been renamed from FullName to Sales_Rep_Name in the Semantic model, but the original name of FullName is still visible inside ofthe parentheses, and this is the name that should be used for the field in the security table, since it matches the name of the field in the DSA source table. A data warehouse security table is populated with the FullNamefield values and the Members that the field values will be mapped to. The Security table has the following two entries:  Example 2: Using Role Members to assign a specific field value to all the role members. Territory is the name of the Semantic model field that the Dynamic Row-LevelSecuritySetup is created under as shown below.  A data warehouse security table is populated with the Territoryfield values and the Members that the field values will be mapped to. Role Members The result is that all the members of the role associated with this security setup will only have access to data in the West territory.   ",
