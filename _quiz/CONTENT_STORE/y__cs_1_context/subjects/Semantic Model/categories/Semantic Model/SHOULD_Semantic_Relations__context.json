    "Text": "In semantic tables, a relationship is a connection between two tables of data. The relation establishes a correlation between the data in the two tables defining how the data from each table will relate to the data in theother table. For example, a Customers table and an Invoices table can be related so that the customer name can be shown with anassociated invoice. The Relations folder in the table tree lists out all the relations for that table, which means that the same relation will be listed out under eachof the relatedtables. A newly created relation will have adefault name of the two table names separated by a hyphen, butthisdefault name can be amendedas needed.  When adding relations, the available settings depend on the types of endpoints that have been selected for the Semantic instance. To add a new relation on a model where Qlik is the only endpoint type enabled Use the following steps to add a new relation on a Semantic model where the enabled endpoint type is either SSAS Tabular, PowerBI Premium or Tableau.  Note: To add a new relation item to an existing relation Multiple relations may existbetween two tables. The first relation will be designated as the default relation, which isnecessary in some endpoints. To set a relation as the default relation Note: Each relation has cardinality. In the tree, the cardinality can be identified on the relation items as follows: To change the cardinality for a relation Note: Each relation also has a filter direction. To change the filter direction If relations have already been created inthe data area of a DWH instance, then these relations mayautomatically be brought in when one of the data area tables are added totheSemantic Instance. In order for this to work, the dimension tables shouldfirst be added to the Semantic instance prior to adding the associated fact table. The fields that comprise the relations do not need to be added themselves, the relations on the DWH tables just need to be deployed prior to adding the tables to the Semantic model. The same holds true when adding the fact table. The specific fields in the relation do not need to be added themselves, and the relation should come over automatically. When thefact table is added,a menu will be presented with all the existing relations andoptions are available to select which relations to use. For example, if the fact table contains more than one date field, then the specific date fieldto use for the relationship with the date table can be selected. Once this is complete,the fields used for the relations will be added as hidden fields. https://use.vg/RT7JQV ",
