    "Text": "To analyze data over time, it's common to include a date dimension in your data model. By adding a date table to your data area, you can provide the semantic instance with a time dimension that can be used in calculations. Date tables are typically added to semantic instances because they simplify the calculation needed to compare different dates related to each other. In addition to using various components of the date value as time dimensions (Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year), date tables also contain indexes that help determine the relation of any date value to the current date. Updating a Date Table Custom time periods can be added to account for special periods of time such as holidays or yearly sales campaigns. These custom periods can be comprised of one or more individual time periods and provide a quick and convenient way to account for these special periods of time. To add a date table, follow the steps below.   After your date table is deployed, you can complete the following to create a data hierarchy. After setting this change, the table will now have the following fields set. The following example shows creating an import file for the 2023 holidays usingthe required time period format of name;startdate;enddate . After the file is imported, the necessaryfields will be created and appear as follows.    @Thomas Lind I am not sure if this is the correct place to drop a question but it is related to the toppic..  I set the date display to 'DD-MM-YYY in the 'Edit Date Table settings. After deploying and executing the DateValue is presented as 'MM-DD-YYY.  What could be wrong?    @boyclaesen It is due to the Date format you have chosen.  If I preview it it looks like this. Notice the Date format and compare it to the DisplayDate. If I click on Query Tool it again looks different. If I were to change it to look like yours with slash instead of - and dd-mm-yyyy format it will look like this. The preview and in the query tool.  I hope this explains it. I myself prefer a date format that includes the hour:minute:second part as well as the date as I often work with almost equal date values. @Thomas Lind @boyclaesen as far as I know the Date display formatting options directly affect the filling of any varchar type fields in the Date table. With the top line of options only deciding the ordering of day/month/year and the bottom row determining the separator (even if the top row shows - ). The display of datetime and date are decided by the formatting you choose in the preview dialog. Other SQL Server tools like Management Studio may differ as this can depend on collation and regional settings. I have a question about my date table. First day of the week is set to Monday and First week of the year is set to Starts on Jan 1. But week 1 only has one day (Jan 1), and it's already week 2 on Jan 2:   Is that the expected behavior? I'm guessing my settings for First day of the week and First week of the year are incompatible (US versus European)? @RLB the first of January was a Sunday, so that would make week two start on the Monday. TX's date table gives you full control over those settings, if your SQL settings deviate that would make function calls used elsewhere mismatch I expect. Here in NW Europe we usually use ISO 8601 (which is TX's default setup I think) numbering. think https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/weeknum-function-e5c43a03-b4ab-426c-b411-b18c13c75340 But you're right, my SQL settings deviate from the date table settings which causes issues. @RLB  tl;dr: a weeknumber may not always represent 7 days, weeknumber 1 is not in the previous year (almost 100%), weeknumbers are like all things dates: overly complicated.
