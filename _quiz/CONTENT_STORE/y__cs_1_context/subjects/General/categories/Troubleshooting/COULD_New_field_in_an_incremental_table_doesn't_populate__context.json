Without additional intervention, the new field will only be populated for records created or modified after the field was added. Use Keep field values up-to-date on the table you add the lookup field to. If you do not want to use that, use the below methods. ",

                "If the new field is a lookup, it's possible to copy out the section of the Data Cleansing Script that performs the lookup and run it manually as well. Since the script to applies the lookup to the raw table, you will need to make a minor modification to apply the update to the valid table instead."
