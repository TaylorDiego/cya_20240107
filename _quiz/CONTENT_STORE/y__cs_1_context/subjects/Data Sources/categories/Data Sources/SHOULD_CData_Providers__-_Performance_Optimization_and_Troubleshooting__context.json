    "Text": "This article describes general techniques to optimize performance of CData Providers and to troubleshoot errors or unexpected behavior during data extraction. For specific provider-related techniques, refer to the provider documentation. A CData providersperformance is largely dependent on the data source and the amount of data. Decreasing the amount of data retrieved will improve performance. Queries with multiple joins, many columns, large number of rows, etc. take longer. filters Logfiles can be generated by setting two properties: 3 1 Verbosity Levels: Note: Verbosity levels 3 and higher can capture sensitive client data, including: masks sensitive values The provider version can be obtained from the log file. It is printed out whenever a connection is opened. For example: Version version error message stack trace CData class query order request format data response errors data INFO|Connec Every CData provider has a major and minor version: i.e., 22.0.8413 EXEC Parsed HTTP Req HTTP Res: 0 The response can be used to determine if missing data was returned by the API. It may also contain a more detailed error message. InitiateOAuth   OAuthSettingsLocation   per user OAuthSettingsLocation 400 (Bad Request)  external tool Postman URL Header. Timeouts can occur because of the Timeout connection property or due to the data source. Timeout 0 timestamps Review  Timeouts on databases  for more details on timeout issues. ",
