This method specifies a user account that does not have MFA two factor authentication enabled and has been granted access to the SharePoint site. The configuration in the TimeXtender Portal for the SharePoint data source is as follows: This method uses an Azure App Registrationand OAuth to connect to the specified SharePoint site.     To anyone that is going to set up a data source with method 2 (in my case SharePoint Online): if you forget step 12 (Set the Schema toREST.) you will run into this error when clickin on Authorize OAuth:   post on the community @Greg Lennox  Where you say the file types to retrieve. Is it the same setup for Excel files or CSV files?

So you want to use the provider to get SharePoint lists like this. If you want to connect to the files stored in the SharePoint, you will need to use the specific provider for that file type.
