Some features only available in TimeXtender SaaS include: The new SaaS version of TimeXtender differs significantlyfrom v20.10 and below. Some features from the older version are no longer present, such as: We strongly encourage you toreview the release notes and test thoroughly before upgrading to understand the changes and the potential impact on your operations. To run theMigration Tool, you must first create atarget instancesand data sources to match your old environment Add and Configure Instances The number of instances and data sources that need to be setup depends on the project that is being migrated. For example, if you have a project in version 20.10 that contains 5 semantic models, 1 Business Unit, 1 ODX,and a total of 8 data sources between the ODX and the business units (4 data sources in Business Unit and 4 data sources in ODX), then you will need to create 1 MDW instance, 5 SSL instances, 1 ODX instance, and all 8 data sources in the TX Portalbefore attempting to run the migration tool.    Hi Christian, We're excited to get to work using the new migration tool! I have a couple of questions about the database used for storage in version 20.10 and the database used for storage in the destination instance: Thanks in advance, Andrew - E-mergo Hi Christian, Good news the migrationtool is available now. Another prerequisite is to upgrade the legacy version to version 20.10.45 (or higher if newer versions are released)so the migration tool becomes available in the Tools menu. Might be good to add that where the prerequisites are mentioned. Greetings, Roy Hi For making it easy to know what you need to do I made a checklist. Initially it was for internal use, but it can be used by everyone who is in the process of doing a migration. You will need to upgrade to the newest version of LTS (Long Time Support) before doing this and that is also not part of this guide. ",
