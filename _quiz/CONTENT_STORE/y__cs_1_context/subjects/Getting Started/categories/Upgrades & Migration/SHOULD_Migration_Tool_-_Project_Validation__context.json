    "Text": "This article describes the various objects thatcannot be migrated from version 20.10 to the next generation of TimeXtender. The Migration Tool will not allow these objects to be migrated, and while some of these affected objects can be ignored and themigration process cancontinue, there are other types of objects that cannot be ignored and must be resolved prior to being able to continue on withthe migration. The following outlines the Project Validalidation step in the Migration Tooland how to handle the specific types of objects that cannot be migrated. Next For affected objects thatcan be skipped, the migration tool will displaya warning that highlightsthe affected object. In the example below, there is awarning displayed because the project contains Data Exports, which is something that cannot be migrated. By selecting the checkbox I confirm that the listed items will not be migrated, the affected object will be skipped during the migration process. These objects do not have to be manually changed or deleted prior to continuing on with the migration. The following objects, features, and settingscannot be migrated, but can be skipped during migration, so no further action is required.  The following objects, feature,s and settingscannot be migrated, and cannot be skipped during migration. These itemsmust be manually changed or deleted prior to being able to continue on withthemigration. Delete Time Table Delete External Business Unit A project variable of type \"System\" and value \"Environment Name\" cannot be migrated. For project variables of other types such as Source, Destination, and Contextual Scope, only the value Name can be migrated. Other values for these types of project variables cannot be migrated. Use the following steps to remove a project variable that cannot be migrated. Use the following steps to remove this deprecated setting. Use the following steps to remove this deprecated setting. The following SQL query can be used on the TimeXtender repository database to locate lookup fields that containdeprecated settings: Use the following steps to remove conditional lookups with these deprecated settings The following SQL query can be used on the TimeXtender repository database to locate the conditional lookups that contain thesedeprecated settings. Use the following steps to remove these deprecated settings from field mappings.   The following SQL query can be usedon the TimeXtender repository database to locate the fields that usethe split data movement method. The following SQL query can be usedon the TimeXtender repository database to locate the fields that usethe concatenation data movement method.
