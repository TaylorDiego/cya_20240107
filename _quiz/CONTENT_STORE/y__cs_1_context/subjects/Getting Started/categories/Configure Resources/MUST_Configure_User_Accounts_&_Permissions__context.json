    "Text": "For TimeXtender to ingests data from sources and write data to the target data storages it must have the proper permissions. This is done by configuring users accounts within a security group and then providing that security group the necessary permissions below. Identify and/or create the following useraccounts. For Cloud deployment, Azure Active Directory (AAD), is recommended. If utilizing Azure AnalysisServicesthen Azure Active Directory is required. For On-Premise deployments, Active Directory (AD) is recommended, but not required. Since you will need to provide the same permissions to any users working on TimeXtender as well as the service accounts running TimeXtender services, will make it easier create and manager permissions for all users at once using a Security Group.
