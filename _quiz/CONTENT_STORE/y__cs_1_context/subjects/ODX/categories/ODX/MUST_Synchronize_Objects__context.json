    "Text": "In TimeXtender, the synchronization of data sources and objects is necessary to ensure that the ODX metadata matches up with that in the data source. Synchronization can be performed either as a task for the entire data source or on specific data source objects. This article describes the difference between the synchronize task and synchronizing objects in an ODX instance, and when to use each feature respectively. The synchronize task on the data source levelsynchronizes the structure of the source with the metadata stored in the ODX. For example, if a column is added in the source, and the ODX is configuredto include all the columns from that data source table,then executing the synchronize task will ensure that the column is also added to the ODX metadata. Furthermore,when the transfer task is subsequentlyexecuted the new column will alsobe included.If a column is renamed in the data source, then executing the synchronize task will ensure that an invalid column name error is not thrown the next time the transfer task is executed. Synchronize objects in the ODXidentifies Data Warehouse instances that are impacted by structural changes in the ODX.For example, if a column is renamed in the source, and the synchronization task has been run, the ODX transfer task will succeed, but theData Warehousetable execution (with a mapping to this field that has undergone the name change) will fail with the following error. In this example, the Name column in the Currency table was renamed to CName. As a result, the Name column no longer exists in the ODX, and the next execution of the table will fail because the mapping of the field has been brokenin the Data Warehouse table. Perform the following steps to resolve this type oferror.  ",

The data type suggestion can also be reviewed by right-clicking on the Data Warehouse data area or table, clicking Advanced, and then selecting Synchronize Data Types."
