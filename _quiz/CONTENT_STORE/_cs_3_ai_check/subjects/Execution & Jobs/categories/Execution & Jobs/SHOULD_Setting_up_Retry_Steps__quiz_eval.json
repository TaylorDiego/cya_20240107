            "The question is clear and directly related to the content provided. It tests the understanding of the 'Retries per Step' and 'Retries' configuration, which is a key concept in the article. The options are well-structured and plausible, which makes the question challenging. The explanation is also clear and concise. However, the question could be improved by providing a bit more context about what these configurations are used for. Overall, I would rate this question a 4 out of 5."
