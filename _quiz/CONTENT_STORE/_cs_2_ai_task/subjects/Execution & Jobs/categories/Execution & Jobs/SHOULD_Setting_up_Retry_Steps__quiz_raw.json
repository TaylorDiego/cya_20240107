        "question": "Why might an execution package fail due to an error with a data source?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Because the data source is permanently unavailable",
            "option_b": "Due to a syntax error in the execution package",

        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "Data sources may be temporarily locked by updates or backups, causing a collision and failure."

        "question": "What is the purpose of 'Retry steps' in execution packages?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "To fix data integrity issues",
            "option_b": "To wait and retry when a data source is temporarily unavailable",
            "option_c": "To increase the speed of execution",

        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Retry steps allow the execution to wait and retry if a data source is temporarily unavailable."

        "question": "If you want one step to be retried up to three times, how should 'Retries per Step' and 'Retries' be configured?",

            "option_a": "'Retries per Step' should be 1 and 'Retries' should be 3",
