        "question": "What is the primary purpose of executing tables in TimeXtender?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "To modify the structure of existing tables",
            "option_b": "To transfer and cleanse data into tables that have been deployed",
            "option_c": "To generate reports from the data",
            "option_d": "To create new tables without transferring data"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Execution of tables in TimeXtender is done to transfer and cleanse data into tables that have already been deployed, ensuring the data is ready for use."

    "question_2": {
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a step in the execution of tables in TimeXtender?",

        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "The 'Guard on Execution' option prevents a table from being executed, which can be useful to avoid overwriting data that should not be changed."

        "options": {
            "option_a": "It cancels the execution of tables",
            "option_b": "It executes tables immediately",
            "option_c": "It allows users to continue working while execution is performed in the background",
            "option_d": "It sends a notification to the user when execution is complete"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",

        "answer": "option_c",
