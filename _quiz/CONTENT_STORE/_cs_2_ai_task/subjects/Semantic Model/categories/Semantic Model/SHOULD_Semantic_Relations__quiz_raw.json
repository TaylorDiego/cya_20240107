        "question": "How can you add a new relation for a Qlik endpoint in a Semantic model?",

        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "To add a new relation on a model where Qlik is the only endpoint type enabled, you drag a field from one table to a field on another table and click Yes when prompted."
