            "option_a": "Restrict access to specific rows within a table",
            "option_b": "Implement role-based access to the semantic model",

        "question": "How is Row-Level Security configured in TimeXtender?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "By creating a role that is associated with an endpoint",
            "option_b": "By creating a Row-Level Security Setup under a specific field",

        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Row-Level Security is configured by creating a Row-Level Security Setup under a specific field, which specifies which field values the role will have access to."

        "question": "What is the result of associating a role with a Row-Level Security Setup that grants access to West Territory field values?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "The role will have access to data in all territories",
            "option_b": "The role will have access to data only in the East territory",

        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "Associating a role with a Row-Level Security Setup that grants access to West Territory field values means that any role associated with this security setup will not have access to data that is outside of the West territory."
