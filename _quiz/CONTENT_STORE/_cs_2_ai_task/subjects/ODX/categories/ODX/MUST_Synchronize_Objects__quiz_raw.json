    "question_1": {
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of synchronizing data sources and objects in TimeXtender?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "To improve the performance of data transfers",
            "option_b": "To ensure that the ODX metadata matches up with the data source",
            "option_c": "To create backups of the data source",
            "option_d": "To remove outdated data from the ODX"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Synchronization in TimeXtender is essential to ensure that the Operational Data Exchange (ODX) metadata is aligned with the actual structure of the data source, preventing errors during data transfer tasks."
    },
    "question_2": {
        "question": "What happens when the synchronize task is executed after a column is added to the data source?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "The column is removed from the ODX metadata",
            "option_b": "The column is added to the ODX metadata",
            "option_c": "The data source is reset to its original state",
            "option_d": "The ODX metadata is deleted"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Executing the synchronize task after a column is added to the data source ensures that the new column is also added to the ODX metadata, maintaining the structure's consistency."
    },
    "question_3": {
        "question": "What is the consequence of renaming a column in the data source without synchronizing?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "The ODX transfer task will fail",
            "option_b": "The Data Warehouse table execution will fail",
            "option_c": "The renamed column will be duplicated in the ODX",
            "option_d": "The ODX will automatically update the column name"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "If a column is renamed in the data source and the synchronization task is not run, the ODX transfer task might succeed, but the Data Warehouse table execution will fail due to the broken field mapping."
    },
    "question_4": {
        "question": "What should you do first when resolving a synchronization error due to a renamed column in TimeXtender?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Delete the renamed column from the ODX",
            "option_b": "Rename the column back to its original name",
            "option_c": "Open the Data Warehouse instance containing the objects to be synchronized",
            "option_d": "Execute the ODX transfer task again"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "The first step to resolve a synchronization error due to a renamed column is to open the Data Warehouse instance that contains the objects to be synchronized."
    },
    "question_5": {
        "question": "In TimeXtender, what does the 'Synchronize objects' option do?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "It deletes objects that are no longer in use",
            "option_b": "It creates a new instance of the Data Warehouse",
            "option_c": "It identifies any columns in the Data Warehouse instances affected by a change in their field name",
            "option_d": "It synchronizes the time settings of the server"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "'Synchronize objects' in TimeXtender identifies columns in the Data Warehouse instances that are impacted by changes, such as a field name change, in the ODX."
    },
    "question_6": {
        "question": "What happens if the renamed field selected in the Synchronize window has a different data type than the target column?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "TimeXtender will ignore the data type mismatch",
            "option_b": "TimeXtender will suggest a data type for the synchronization",
            "option_c": "The synchronization process will be aborted",
            "option_d": "The original data type will be forcibly applied"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "If there is a data type mismatch during synchronization in TimeXtender, the system will suggest a data type for the synchronization to ensure compatibility between the source and target columns."
