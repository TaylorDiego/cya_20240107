            "option_a": "Drag the ID field from the 'Many' table to the 'One' table",
            "option_b": "Identify a field that exists in both tables to use for the relationship",
            "option_c": "Set the default relation setting in the Edit Instance menu",
            "option_d": "Create a lookup by dragging a field from one table to the other"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "The first step is to identify a common field, typically an ID field, that exists in both tables to establish a relationship."

        "question": "Which of the following data type combinations cannot be used to create a table relationship?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "nvarchar(20) with nvarchar(50)",

        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "A varchar field cannot be used with an nvarchar field to create a relationship due to incompatible data types."
    },
    "question_3": {
        "question": "What happens when you drag an ID field from one table to a corresponding field in another table to create a relationship?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "A message appears to confirm the data types",
            "option_b": "The tables are automatically merged into one",
            "option_c": "A '+' icon appears next to the mouse pointer if the fields are compatible",
            "option_d": "The relationship is created without any further confirmation"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "A '+' icon appears indicating that the fields are compatible and a relationship can be created."
    },

        "question": "What is the default setting when configuring relationship options in a new Data Area?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Add a new relation and set it as default",
            "option_b": "Extend an existing relation",
            "option_c": "Add a new relation",
            "option_d": "No default setting is provided"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "The default setting is generally to 'Extend an existing relation' to avoid filtering out data."

    "question_5": {
        "question": "How are lookups created in a new Data Area after establishing table relationships?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "By using the 'Add Conditional Lookup field' option from the context menu",
            "option_b": "By manually creating a join after dragging a field onto the corresponding field in another table",
            "option_c": "By selecting fields from the Semantic model",
            "option_d": "By configuring the Edit Instance menu"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "After establishing table relationships, a lookup is created by dragging a field from one table to another and then manually creating the required join."

    "question_6": {
        "question": "What is the benefit of having existing table relationships in data areas when building a Semantic model?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "It allows for automatic detection and prompts to bring over the relationship",
            "option_b": "It eliminates the need for a Semantic model",
            "option_c": "It automatically merges dimension and fact tables",
            "option_d": "It changes the data types of fields to be compatible"
        },
        "answer": "option_a",
        "explanation": "Existing table relationships in data areas are beneficial because they are automatically detected and prompt the user to decide whether to bring over the relationship when building a Semantic model."
