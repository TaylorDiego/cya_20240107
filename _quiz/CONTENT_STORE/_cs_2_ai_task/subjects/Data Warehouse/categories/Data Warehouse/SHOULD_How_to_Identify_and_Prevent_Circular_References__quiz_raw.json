        "question": "What is a circular reference in the context of data models?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "A reference where a field is updated by a user",
            "option_b": "An instance where a field is looking back to itself to populate its value",
            "option_c": "A reference that connects two unrelated tables",
            "option_d": "A field that is referencing a primary key in another table"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "A circular reference occurs when a field in a data model is somehow looking back to itself when attempting to populate its value, creating a loop."

    "question_2": {
        "question": "What is a good practice to avoid circular references between dimension tables?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Create multiple lookups between the tables",
            "option_b": "Only create lookups on both sides of the relation",
            "option_c": "Only create lookups on one side of the relation between two tables",
            "option_d": "Avoid using dimension tables altogether"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "To prevent circular references, it is recommended to only create lookups on one side of the relation between two tables, not both."

        "question": "What might newer versions of TimeXtender do when a circular reference is detected?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Automatically correct the circular reference",
            "option_b": "Ignore the circular reference",

            "option_d": "Create a backup of the data model"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "Newer versions of TimeXtender may be able to detect circular references and will display an error message to alert the user."

        "question": "In a complex data warehouse, where are circular references more likely to occur?",
