        "question": "What is a role-playing dimension in the context of a data warehouse?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "A dimension that plays a critical role in data analysis",
            "option_b": "A dimension that can be used in multiple contexts within the same model",
            "option_c": "A dimension that is only used once in a data model",
            "option_d": "A dimension that contains role-based access control"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "A role-playing dimension is one that can be reused in different contexts within the same data model, depending on its relationship to the fact table."
    },
    "question_2": {
        "question": "What is the first sign that you may benefit from a role-playing dimension?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Your fact table has only one foreign key related to the dimension table",
            "option_b": "Your dimension table has multiple foreign keys",
            "option_c": "Your fact table has more than one foreign key related to the same dimension table",
            "option_d": "You have redundant tables in your data warehouse"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "The first sign that a role-playing dimension could be beneficial is when your fact table has multiple foreign keys that relate to the same dimension table."
    },
    "question_3": {
        "question": "How do you add a role-playing dimension to a TimeXtender semantic model?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "By creating a new dimension table for each role",
            "option_b": "By adding the dimension to the semantic model multiple times with different names and relationships",
            "option_c": "By duplicating the fact table",
            "option_d": "By manually editing the SQL queries in the model"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "To add a role-playing dimension in TimeXtender, you add the same dimension to the semantic model several times, each with an appropriate name and relationship to represent its different roles."
    },
    "question_4": {
        "question": "What are the benefits of implementing role-playing dimensions in a data warehouse?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Increased data redundancy and complexity",
            "option_b": "Improved query performance and simplified maintenance",
            "option_c": "Reduced need for data consistency and accuracy",
            "option_d": "More frequent need for updating the semantic model"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Role-playing dimensions create consistency, improve query performance, simplify maintenance, and enhance the depth and breadth of business insights."
