    "question_1": {
        "question": "What is the primary use of the 'Table Classification' setting in TimeXtender's Data Warehouse Table Settings?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "To determine the compression level of the table",
            "option_b": "To configure the table's partitioning scheme",
            "option_c": "To manage execution based on the Managed Execution setting",
            "option_d": "To handle primary key constraint violations"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "The table classification is primarily used when an Execution Package has the Managed Execution setting set to Classification, which helps in managing the execution process."
    },
    "question_2": {
        "question": "In TimeXtender, what does enabling 'Simple Mode' for a table do?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "It compresses the table data for better performance",
            "option_b": "It skips the table on execution or deployment",
            "option_c": "It partitions the table into smaller tables",
            "option_d": "It enables incremental loading of data"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Enabling 'Simple Mode' for a table in TimeXtender tells the system to skip the table on execution or deployment, which may be necessary for certain types of data, such as legacy system data."
    },
    "question_3": {
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a valid option for handling primary key constraint violations in TimeXtender's Data Warehouse Table Settings?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Error",
            "option_b": "Warning",
            "option_c": "Ignore",
            "option_d": "None"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "The valid options for handling primary key constraint violations are 'Use instance setting (error)', 'Error', 'Warning', and 'None'. 'Ignore' is not listed as a valid option."
    },
    "question_4": {
        "question": "What is the effect of disabling 'SCHEMABINDING' in TimeXtender's Data Warehouse Table Settings?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "It enables automatic index generation",
            "option_b": "It allows the use of custom user-defined functions in field transformations",
            "option_c": "It compresses the table data",
            "option_d": "It partitions the table based on a fixed date range"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Disabling 'SCHEMABINDING' for autogenerated user-defined functions allows the use of custom user-defined functions in field transformations, but it is recommended to check this option only if necessary as it may decrease performance."
