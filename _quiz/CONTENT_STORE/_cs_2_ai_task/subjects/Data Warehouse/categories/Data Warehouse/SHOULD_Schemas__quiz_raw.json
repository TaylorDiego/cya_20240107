        "question": "What takes precedence in TimeXtender when applying schema settings?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Data area level settings",
            "option_b": "Table level settings",
            "option_c": "The settings of the last table added",
            "option_d": "The settings of the first data area created"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "In TimeXtender, schema settings applied at the table level take precedence over those applied on the data area."
    },
    "question_2": {
        "question": "What is the default schema for objects in a new data area in TimeXtender?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "dbo",
            "option_b": "The name of the data area",
            "option_c": "The name of the first table in the data area",
            "option_d": "There is no default schema; it must be set manually"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "When adding a data area in TimeXtender, the name provided for the data area will be set as the default schema for the objects in that new data area."
    },
    "question_3": {
        "question": "What happens if you attempt to use an existing schema name for a different data area in TimeXtender?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "The system will automatically rename the schema to avoid conflicts.",
            "option_b": "A warning message will appear, and errors are likely if you proceed.",
            "option_c": "The tables will merge without any issues.",
            "option_d": "The existing data area will be overwritten."
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "If you try to use a schema name that already exists in a different data area, a warning message will appear. Proceeding despite the warning is likely to cause errors due to schema and table name conflicts."
    },
    "question_4": {
        "question": "What should you do if you encounter an error stating that a specific schema name does not exist or you do not have permission to use it during deployment?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Rename the schema to a unique name.",
            "option_b": "Deploy the tables with the 'Only deploy modified tables and views' option unchecked.",
            "option_c": "Ignore the error and continue with the deployment.",
            "option_d": "Manually create the schema in the database before deployment."
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "The error occurs because the 'Only deploy modified tables and views' option excludes the deployment of the new schema. To resolve this, you should deploy without this option checked to include the new schema."
