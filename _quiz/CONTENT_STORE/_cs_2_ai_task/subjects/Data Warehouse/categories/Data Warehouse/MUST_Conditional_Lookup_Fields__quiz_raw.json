        "question": "What is the primary purpose of conditional lookup fields in TimeXtender?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "To delete values from a field in another table",
            "option_b": "To update values in the same table",
            "option_c": "To look up values from a field in another table within the same data area",
            "option_d": "To create new tables in the Data Warehouse"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "Conditional lookup fields are used to look up values from a field in another table within the same data area of a Data Warehouse instance, allowing for the addition of fields from one table to another based on certain conditions."
    },
    "question_2": {
        "question": "What happens if you create a conditional lookup field without specifying any conditions when multiple source lookup fields are present?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "The last lookup field will be used",
            "option_b": "The first lookup field will always be used",
            "option_c": "A random lookup field will be used",
            "option_d": "The lookup will fail and return an error"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "If no conditions are specified for a conditional lookup field with multiple source lookup fields, the first lookup field will always be used and any subsequent lookup fields will be ignored."
    },
    "question_3": {
        "question": "When adding a new conditional lookup field, what options are available if the source and destination tables already have established relationships?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "Use default relation, add new joins, or copy joins from another lookup",
            "option_b": "Delete existing joins and create new ones",
            "option_c": "Ignore existing joins and create a conditional field without joins",
            "option_d": "Use only the default relation without the option to add new joins"
        },
        "answer": "option_a",
        "explanation": "If table relations or joins have already been established between the source and destination tables, the user can choose to use the default relation, add new joins, or copy joins from an existing relation or conditional lookup field."
    },
    "question_4": {
        "question": "What must be configured when creating a conditional lookup field from a history-enabled table?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "A fixed value for all lookups",
            "option_b": "A condition that specifies the date to use when looking up the appropriate record",
            "option_c": "A default relation that cannot be changed",
            "option_d": "A single source field for the lookup"
        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "When creating a conditional lookup field from a history-enabled table, a condition must be configured that specifies the date to use when looking up the appropriate record."

    "question_5": {
        "question": "In TimeXtender, what is the result of selecting 'Take the first non-empty value' in the Multiple lookup fields list?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "The lookup will return the first value that is not NULL",
            "option_b": "The lookup will return the last non-empty value",
            "option_c": "The lookup will return all non-empty values",
            "option_d": "The lookup will return the first value regardless of it being empty or not"
        },
        "answer": "option_a",
        "explanation": "When 'Take the first non-empty value' is selected, the value of the conditional lookup field will be the value of the first lookup field with a condition that evaluates to true and is not empty."
    },
    "question_6": {
        "question": "What is the function of the 'None' operator when adding an additional lookup field to an existing conditional lookup?",
        "options": {
            "option_a": "It deletes the existing lookup field",
            "option_b": "It creates a new conditional lookup field",
            "option_c": "It retrieves the value if there is only one that fits the join",
            "option_d": "It sums up all the values that match the join criteria"
        },
        "answer": "option_c",
        "explanation": "The 'None' operator is used when there is only one value that fits the join criteria. It retrieves this single value for the lookup."
