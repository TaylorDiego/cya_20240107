            "option_a": "The database connection is lost",
            "option_b": "Incremental tables only update new or changed records",

        },
        "answer": "option_b",
        "explanation": "Incremental tables are designed to update only new or changed records. Therefore, a new field will remain NULL for existing records unless the table is fully reloaded or another method is used to update the field."

        "question": "Which method is NOT suggested for updating a new field in an incremental table?",

        "answer": "option_d",
        "explanation": "Ignoring the new field is not a suggested method. The recommended methods include performing a full load, manually updating the field with an UPDATE command, or running the lookup section of the Data Cleansing Script manually with modifications."
