However, re-execution of a task works without failure, indicating that the issue is not consistent or related to a specific table/connection."    },    "question_2": {        "question": "How can you increase the timeout for very large data transfers from ODX to a Data Warehouse when using Azure Data Factory?",        "options": {            "option_a": "Decrease the Connection timeout to less than 30",            "option_b": "Set the timeout to infinite (0)",            "option_c": "Increase the Connection timeout from 30 to 7200",            "option_d": "Edit the ADF data source settings to decrease the number of concurrent tasks"        },        "answer": "option_c",        "explanation": "For very large data transfers, the article suggests increasing the timeouts on the Data Lake storage and specifically mentions editing the Azure Data Factory (ADF) data source settings in the portal to increase the Connection timeout from 30 to 7200, rather than setting it to infinite or decreasing it."    }}
